"""End-to-end smoke test: spawn the real server over stdio and talk MCP to it.

This is the test that was missing when mcp 2.x was released: every other test
imports modules in-process, so a server that crashes while *starting* (or a wheel
that lacks its module data) went unnoticed. Here a fresh interpreter launches
``python -m revit_mcp_server.mcp_server`` exactly as an MCP client would.

The interpreter can be overridden with ``AEC_SMOKE_PYTHON`` so CI can run the very
same test against a wheel installed into a clean virtualenv.
