"""Owns a native (non-CLI) chat loop against the Anthropic API directly.

Sibling to agent_bridge.py, not a replacement for it: agent_bridge.py shells
out to an already-installed, already-authenticated `claude`/`codex` CLI so
the panel gets a real chat surface without this hub owning an LLM agent
loop. This module is the opposite bet - it owns the model call and the
tool-calling loop directly against the Anthropic API using only an API key,
because the CLI-shelling path fails out of the box on a fresh install with
neither CLI on PATH (see docs/0012-native-agent-chat-backend.md for the
decision record). Both modules keep the exact same safety boundary: a
mutating Revit tool call must pass ApprovalGate.check_tool_execution before
it runs, no matter which chat surface requested it - this module is not
exempt, and must never grow a bypass, debug flag, or "trusted mode" for it.

Tool calls are dispatched through the same ProviderRegistry every other
caller in this codebase uses (mcp_server.py's stdio server, panel_server.py's
HTTP shim): `registry.get_all_tools()` already carries the exact
name/description/input_schema shape Anthropic's tool-use API wants, so no
schema translation is needed to build the `tools=[...]` request parameter.

Session state is in-memory only - a module-level dict keyed by session_id
holding the running message list. Conversations are lost on hub restart;
that is an accepted v1 limitation. Persistence is explicitly out of scope.
