"""Presentation metadata for the MCP tool listing.

Providers define tools with terse descriptions and schemas that often leave
individual parameters undocumented. MCP directories (Glama, ToolBench, Smithery,
...) and the LLMs that call the tools both score/depend on three things: a clear
description, a documented input schema, and behaviour annotations
(readOnlyHint / destructiveHint / idempotentHint / openWorldHint).

This module layers that metadata on top of the provider definitions at listing
time. It never changes what a tool does or how it is gated: `enrich_tool` returns
a copy, and the annotations are *derived from* the existing `is_mutating` /
`destructive` flags plus an explicit table of the few tools whose flag alone
would be misleading (for example exports, which are not gated but do write files).
