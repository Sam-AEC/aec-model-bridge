## Security Best Practices

### For Users

✅ **Keep localhost-only** - Never bind to `0.0.0.0` without enterprise hardening
✅ **Update regularly** - Apply security patches within 30 days
✅ **Enable audit logs** - Monitor `%APPDATA%\AECModelBridge\Logs\bridge.jsonl`
✅ **Workspace sandboxing** - Only allow trusted project directories
✅ **Enterprise mode** - Follow [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for HTTPS/OAuth

### For Developers

✅ **Input validation** - All inputs validated against schemas
✅ **No secrets in code** - Use environment variables
✅ **Least privilege** - No privilege elevation
✅ **Exception handling** - Sanitize before returning to client

## Security Hardening Checklist

Before production deployment:

- [ ] Bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` only
- [ ] Workspace directories limited
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] HTTPS configured (if remote access)
- [ ] OAuth2 enabled (if external clients)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Security reviews scheduled
