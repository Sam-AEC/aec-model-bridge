AEC Model Bridge is the open-source Revit MCP server that lets Claude, Codex,
Cursor and other AI assistants read and edit your open Revit model. You approve
every change first. It has two parts: a Python MCP server and a native Revit
add-in. Read-only tools inspect the model straight away. Model changes need an
approved plan by default. [See the approval flow](#how-approval-works).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/readme/works-with.svg" alt="Works with: Claude Desktop, VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Cursor and Codex have documented setup. Other MCP clients such as Claude Code, Windsurf, Cline, Continue, Zed and Gemini CLI should work too. Applications: Revit 2024 to 2027, Rhino, Grasshopper, Navisworks (in progress). Data: IFC, Speckle, Excel, SQLite. Protocol: MCP over stdio with an approval gate." width="900">
</p>

Setup is documented for Claude Desktop, VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Cursor and
Codex. The server is a standard MCP stdio server, so other clients such as
Claude Code, Windsurf, Cline, Continue, Zed and Gemini CLI should work too. The
[compatibility](docs/compatibility.md) page lists what is documented and what
is untested.

The same server also inspects IFC files, automates Rhino and Grasshopper, and
connects to Speckle. [Integration status](#other-integrations) shows which
providers are available and which are still in progress.

## Example workflows

For BIM coordinators: check model quality, review the affected elements,
approve a parameter fix, then check the result and export a report. These
examples use tools in the [current catalog](docs/tools-generated.md).

| Workflow | Example request | Tools used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model review | "Show the active document, list its warnings and find affected elements." | `revit_get_document_info`, `revit_get_warnings`, `revit_get_elements_by_type` |
| Parameter updates | "Find walls on Level 02, show their Comments values, and propose a batch update." | `revit_get_elements_by_type`, `revit_get_element_parameters`, `revit_batch_set_parameters` |
| Drawing production | "Prepare a sheet list from this CSV, then propose creating the sheets and placing the views." | `revit_batch_create_sheets_from_csv`, `revit_place_viewport_on_sheet` |
| IFC review | "Show this IFC file's storeys, inspect the wall properties and report schema validation issues." | `ifc_get_spatial_structure`, `ifc_get_properties`, `ifc_validate` |

For a first run in Revit, try:

```text
Read the active model's warnings. Group them by description and show the
affected element IDs. Then suggest which issues to investigate first.
```

Then try a parameter correction, replacing the level and value for your project:

```text
Find walls on Level 02 and show their current Comments values. Propose setting
Comments to "Coordination reviewed" for the elements I choose. After I approve
the plan in Revit, apply it and read the values back to confirm the result.
```

For edits, the assistant creates a plan with `plan_actions`. You review it in
the Revit panel, and only then does `execute_plan` apply it. IFC review runs
without Revit.

The snapshot QA/QC and report modules need a compatible saved snapshot. The
handoff from Revit to these modules currently needs the filename and workspace
to match. If you leave out `snapshot_id`, they can return generated sample
data. For live inspection, use the direct Revit tools above.
[Planned fixes and demo](docs/roadmap.md).

## Quick start

**One-click install**

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_in-VS_Code-0098FF?style=for-the-badge)](docs/install-buttons.md#vs-code)
[![Install in Cursor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_in-Cursor-111111?style=for-the-badge)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=aec-model-bridge&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IiwiYXJncyI6WyItLWZyb20iLCJnaXQraHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1NhbS1BRUMvYWVjLW1vZGVsLWJyaWRnZSNzdWJkaXJlY3Rvcnk9cGFja2FnZXMvbWNwLXNlcnZlci1yZXZpdCIsImFlYy1tb2RlbC1icmlkZ2UiXSwiZW52Ijp7Ik1DUF9SRVZJVF9NT0RFIjoiYnJpZGdlIn19)
[![Claude Desktop bundle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude_Desktop-.mcpb_bundle-D97757?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Sam-AEC/aec-model-bridge/releases/latest)

The buttons need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
and nothing else. The server uses `~/Documents/AEC Model Bridge` as its
workspace unless you set your own. For Claude Desktop, download the `.mcpb`
file from the latest release and open it. Live Revit work still needs Revit and
[the add-in](#install-the-revit-add-in). Mock mode needs neither.

**Manual setup**

For live Revit automation you need Windows, a licensed Revit 2024 to 2027,
Python 3.11 or newer, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), and the Revit add-in
([install steps](#install-the-revit-add-in)). Then add this to your
`claude_desktop_config.json` (Codex, Cursor and VS Code use the same values;
the two directory variables are optional and default to the workspace above):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aec-model-bridge": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/Sam-AEC/aec-model-bridge#subdirectory=packages/mcp-server-revit",
        "aec-model-bridge"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_REVIT_MODE": "bridge",
        "MCP_REVIT_WORKSPACE_DIR": "C:\\RevitProjects",
        "MCP_REVIT_ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES": "C:\\RevitProjects"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Want to look at the tools first, without Revit? Set `"MCP_REVIT_MODE": "mock"`.
The server then starts on any machine, lists every tool with its schema and
returns canned responses. It does not touch a model. A `Dockerfile` for the same mock
mode is in the repository root (`docker build -t aec-model-bridge .`, then
`docker run -i --rm aec-model-bridge`).

Using VS Code? The [extension source and local install steps](extensions/vscode/README.md)
register the MCP server and show the Revit connection status. It has not been
published to the Marketplace.

### Tools at a glance

| Area | Tools | What they do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revit | 103 | Read the model, create and edit elements, parameters, views, sheets, schedules, exports, worksharing |
| Approval | 6 | Plan, review, approve, execute and roll back model changes |
| Modules | 34 | Snapshot inspection, parameter grids, QA/QC checks, recipes, reports, selections |
| Rhino and Grasshopper | 19 | Geometry, layers, materials, boolean operations |
| Speckle | 17 | Projects, models, versions, send and receive |
| Navisworks | 15 | Model tree, viewpoints, clash tests (in progress) |
| IFC | 7 | Read IFC files without Revit: structure, properties, validation |
| Graph, snapshots, exports, jobs | 18 | Semantic graph audits, snapshot diffs, SQLite export, background jobs |

219 tools are listed in the default setup (counted from the current server in mock
mode). The Autodesk Data tools appear when APS credentials are configured. The
[tool reference](docs/tools-generated.md) lists every tool. Each tool carries
MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`,
`openWorldHint`), so clients can tell reads from writes.

### Advanced Revit automation

Alongside model queries and parameter updates, Revit tools create building
elements, views, sheets, schedules, tags and dimensions, and export IFC, DWG,
images and Navisworks files. See the [tool reference](docs/tools-generated.md)
for supported operations and inputs.

For anything the tool catalog does not cover, `revit_invoke_method`,
`revit_reflect_get` and `revit_reflect_set` work with public Revit API members.
`revit_execute_python` runs IronPython inside Revit. These advanced tools have
the same permissions as the Revit process. Use them only with MCP clients and
prompts you trust.

## How it works

The MCP client talks to one Python hub. The hub sends each call to the
provider that owns the tool. Providers for desktop apps talk to a small add-in
inside that app over localhost.

Teal boxes work today. The amber dashed boxes are in progress. Indigo
shapes are data and external services.

### How approval works

The hub stops any tool call that changes the model unless it carries an
approved plan. The default mode is `required`. The AI proposes a plan, you
review it in the Revit side panel, and the add-in runs it on Revit's main
thread in a named transaction.

    <img src="docs/images/approval-flow-light.png" alt="Approval flow: the AI assistant proposes a plan, the MCP hub and ApprovalGate show it in the Revit side panel, and only after you approve does execute_plan forward the commands to the Revit add-in, which runs them in one named transaction. If you reject or never approve, the call is blocked and the model stays untouched." width="900">
  </picture>
</p>

<sub>Diagram source: [approval-flow.mmd](docs/diagrams/approval-flow.mmd). Regenerate the images with `python scripts/render_diagrams.py`.</sub>

If a plan is approved and later turns out wrong, `rollback_plan` reverses it.
Rollback uses Revit Undo in the same session or inverse parameter values.
Operations that cannot be reversed, such as file output, ask for a second
confirmation. The lifecycle is in
[ADR 0008](docs/0008-approval-gate-lifecycle.md).

For unattended pipelines you can set `MCP_REVIT_APPROVAL_MODE=auto`. That turns
the human check off, so use it only in a controlled environment.

## Supported Revit versions

| Revit version | Add-in target | Build tools |
|---|---|---|
| 2024 | .NET Framework 4.8 | .NET 8 SDK and .NET Framework 4.8 developer pack |
| 2025 | .NET 8 for Windows | .NET 8 SDK |
| 2026 | .NET 8 for Windows | .NET 8 SDK |
| 2027 | .NET 10 for Windows | .NET 10 SDK |

You also need Windows 10 or 11, Python 3.11 or later, and a licensed Revit
installation for the version you use. Mock mode runs the server without Revit,
which is useful for development and tests.

### Other integrations

| Integration | Status |
|---|---|
| Revit | Available. Native C# add-in. |
| IFC (IfcOpenShell) | Available. Reads IFC files without Revit running. |
| Rhino and Grasshopper | Available. Connects to the Rhino add-in on `localhost:3004`. |
| Speckle | Available. Needs a Speckle client ID in your environment. |
| Navisworks Manage | In progress. The provider and its tools are registered. The Navisworks add-in is not finished. |
| Power BI | In progress. The provider and tool exist but are not registered in the hub. |

## Install the Revit add-in

**Easiest (Windows):** download `AECModelBridge-Setup-<version>.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Sam-AEC/aec-model-bridge/releases/latest), double-click it, pick your Revit versions and restart Revit. It installs the add-in and the bundled Python server. If you tick the box, it also sets up Claude Desktop and VS Code, and it backs up your current settings first. Uninstall it from Windows Settings. The steps below are for building from source.

You install two parts: the Python MCP server and the Revit add-in. Live Revit
automation needs both.

### 1. Install the MCP server

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Sam-AEC/aec-model-bridge.git
cd aec-model-bridge

py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e packages/mcp-server-revit
```

### 2. Install the Revit add-in

Set the version to match your Revit installation. If Windows blocks the
downloaded scripts, right-click each `.ps1` file, open Properties, and select
Unblock before running them.

```powershell
$RevitVersion = Read-Host "Revit year (2024, 2025, 2026, or 2027)"

.\scripts\package.ps1 -RevitVersion $RevitVersion
.\scripts\install.ps1 -RevitVersion $RevitVersion
```

The installer places version-specific binaries in:

```text
C:\ProgramData\AECModelBridge\bin\<year>
```

The add-in manifest is installed per user in:

```text
%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\<year>
```

Use `-AllUsers` with `install.ps1` to install the manifest under
`C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\<year>` instead.

To prepare binaries for every supported version in one pass:

```powershell
.\scripts\package.ps1 -RevitVersion All
```

Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/Sam-AEC/aec-model-bridge/releases/latest)
has a ready-made package per Revit year, for example
`aec-model-bridge-revit-2026-<version>.zip`. Unzip it and run
`.\install.ps1 -RevitVersion 2026` instead of building from source. For a double-click
Windows installer, `scripts/build-installer.ps1` builds one with Inno Setup.
The full guide, with troubleshooting, is in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Connect Claude Desktop to Revit

Add the server to your MCP client configuration. For Claude Desktop, that is
the `mcpServers` section of `claude_desktop_config.json`. Codex, Cursor, VS
Code and other MCP clients use the same `command`, `args` and `env` values in
their own config format.

Use the Python executable from your virtual environment, and choose a workspace
folder the server may access:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aec-model-bridge": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\aec-model-bridge\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "revit_mcp_server.mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_REVIT_MODE": "bridge",
        "MCP_REVIT_WORKSPACE_DIR": "C:\\RevitProjects",
        "MCP_REVIT_ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES": "C:\\RevitProjects"
      }
    },
    "aec-model-bridge-revit-2026": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\aec-model-bridge\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "revit_mcp_server.mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_REVIT_MODE": "bridge",
        "MCP_REVIT_HOST_VERSION": "2026",
        "MCP_REVIT_WORKSPACE_DIR": "C:\\RevitProjects",
        "MCP_REVIT_ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES": "C:\\RevitProjects"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Leave out `MCP_REVIT_HOST_VERSION` to target the newest open Revit instance.
Set it to a year such as `2024` or `2026` to lock a client entry to that Revit
version. `MCP_REVIT_BRIDGE_URL` overrides the endpoint for advanced setups.

VS Code users can start from [`.vscode/mcp.json`](.vscode/mcp.json). Hermes
Desktop users can start from [`docs/examples/hermes-desktop.json`](docs/examples/hermes-desktop.json) after replacing the
placeholder Python path. Clients that support MCP Bundles can install the
`.mcpb` file from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Sam-AEC/aec-model-bridge/releases/latest).
The Revit add-in is still required, because the server talks to the running
desktop application.

### Check the connection

Restart Revit after installing the add-in, open a model, and run:

```powershell
$registry = Get-ChildItem "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AECModelBridge\registry\revit-*.json" | Select-Object -First 1
$switch = Get-Content $registry.FullName -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
Invoke-RestMethod "$($switch.endpoint)/health"
```

The response should report `healthy` and the running Revit version. In Revit,
look for the `AEC Bridge` ribbon tab. Its Workflows panel has Open Panel,
Health Check, Pending Actions and Reports. Its Tools panel has Config, Help
and About.

## Security

- The Revit bridge listens on localhost only.
- The server reads and writes only inside the folders in
  `MCP_REVIT_ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES`.
- Mutating tools need an approved plan unless you turn approval off.
- Tool calls are written to an audit log, and secrets are redacted.

Details are in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md). To report a
vulnerability, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## FAQ

### What is an MCP server for Revit?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI assistants
call tools in other software. An MCP server for Revit publishes Revit
operations as tools. The assistant picks the tools, and the add-in runs them
inside Revit.

### Which AI assistants work with it?

Any MCP client that can start a local stdio server. Setup is documented for
Claude Desktop, VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Cursor and Codex, and for clients
that read a standard `mcpServers` configuration. Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code,
Continue, Zed, Claude Code and Gemini CLI should work the same way but have not
been tested. See [compatibility](docs/compatibility.md). The panel chat can also
use an Anthropic API key, or the `claude` or `codex` command-line tools if they
are installed. See [ADR 0012](docs/0012-native-agent-chat-backend.md).

### Can the AI change my model without asking?

Not in the default mode. Tools that change the model are blocked until a plan
is approved in the Revit panel. Read-only tools run without approval. If you
set `MCP_REVIT_APPROVAL_MODE=auto`, approval is skipped.

### Does it send my model to the cloud?

The server and the add-in run on your machine, and the bridge listens on
localhost. The AI assistant sees what the tools return, and those results go
to the model provider behind your client. Cloud providers, such as Speckle,
only run when you configure them and call their tools.

### Does it work with IFC files without Revit?

Yes. The IFC provider reads files with IfcOpenShell. It can return file
metadata, the spatial structure, element properties and bounding boxes, run
queries by class, GUID, name or property, and validate the schema. It does
not edit IFC files.

### Can I use it without Revit installed?

Only in mock mode, which is meant for development and tests. Live model work
needs Revit 2024 to 2027 and the add-in.

## Releases and versions

AEC Model Bridge follows Semantic Versioning. Releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` on
GitHub, and a root `VERSION` file holds the version number. See
[docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md) for the release process and
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each version.

## Development

```powershell
# Python tests
python -m pytest packages/mcp-server-revit/tests

# Build one Revit version, for example 2026
.\scripts\build-addin.ps1 -RevitVersion 2026 -Configuration Release

# Build all supported versions
.\scripts\package.ps1 -RevitVersion All
```

CI builds the Python server and the add-in targets for Revit 2024 through 2027.
