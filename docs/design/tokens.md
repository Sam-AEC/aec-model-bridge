# AEC Model Bridge — design tokens

Status: **proposed**, pending maintainer approval.
Scope: the brand mark, the color system, typography, and the ribbon icon
grammar for `assets/logo.svg`, `packages/revit-bridge-addin/src/UI/IconGenerator.cs`,
and `panel/styles.css`.

This file is the single source of truth. There is **no codegen and no token
sync tool** — that is deliberate (ADR-free decision for a solo maintainer with
no bundler in `panel/`). Every value below is hand-copied into the three
renderers, and each copy site carries the comment:

```
// keep in sync with docs/design/tokens.md
```

Companion file: `docs/design/review.html` — open it in a browser to see every
token on this page rendered at real size.

## 1. What is being replaced

| Today | Problem |
| --- | --- |
| `assets/logo.svg` — isometric cube + "AEC / BRIDGE" text | Cube #1 |
| `IconGenerator.CreateBrandIcon()` — a *different* isometric cube, gradient-shaded | Cube #2, disagrees with cube #1 |
| `panel/styles.css` `.brand-mark` — a 3-color gradient square | Not a cube at all; disagrees with both |
| 9 ribbon icons, 8 unrelated accent hues | No system; nothing means anything |
| `pending` = violet on the ribbon, grey in `.badge.pending` | Same concept, two colors |

All five are replaced by **one mark** and **one palette** below.

---

## 2. The mark — "the Span"

### 2.1 Concept

A span, drawn flat: **two anchor nodes joined by a deck, and the bridge itself
standing above them.** It is the existing `CreateConnectIcon()` motif promoted
to primary mark — the same three parts, reproportioned and resolved.

- **Two anchor nodes** joined by a **deck** — the model and the agent, the two
  things being connected.
- **One apex** above them — the bridge process.

Four shapes: one line, two circles, one triangle. No gradients, no shading, no
3D. That is what makes it reproducible to the pixel in SVG, WPF
`DrawingVisual` and CSS, which the cube never was.

**The apex is not tied to the nodes by drawn lines.** It is tied to them by
alignment: the apex's base edge and the deck are both exactly `0.340` wide and
sit on the same two vertical axes, `x = 0.330` and `x = 0.670`. One module,
stated twice. Drawn connector lines were tried in five variants and every one
of them turned the mark into a capital **A** — the connector continues the
apex's own leg, and the deck becomes the crossbar. Alignment says the same
thing and stays a mark.

### 2.2 Geometry — exact

All coordinates are fractions of a `size × size` box, same convention as
`IconGenerator.cs` (multiply by `size`). Origin top-left, y grows downward.

| # | Element | Geometry | Stroke | Fill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Apex wash | closed polygon `(0.500, 0.085)` → `(0.670, 0.430)` → `(0.330, 0.430)` | none | brand wash |
| 2 | Node wash, left | circle center `(0.190, 0.725)`, r `0.140` | none | ink wash |
| 3 | Node wash, right | circle center `(0.810, 0.725)`, r `0.140` | none | ink wash |
| 4 | Deck | line `(0.330, 0.725)` → `(0.670, 0.725)` | **ink** | — |
| 5 | Node, left | circle center `(0.190, 0.725)`, r `0.140` | **ink** | none |
| 6 | Node, right | circle center `(0.810, 0.725)`, r `0.140` | **ink** | none |
| 7 | Apex | closed polygon `(0.500, 0.085)` → `(0.670, 0.430)` → `(0.330, 0.430)` | **brand** | none |

Draw in the order given (1 → 7). Rows 1–3 are unstroked fills painted first;
rows 4–7 are unfilled strokes painted on top. Rows 1 and 7 are the same
polygon, once filled and once stroked — in SVG that is a single `<polygon>`
with both `fill` and `stroke`; the two rows are split here only because WPF
`DrawGeometry(fill, pen, geo)` and CSS take them separately.

The same geometry is used at **every** size, 16 px to 300 px. There is no
optical-size variant to keep in sync across three renderers.

Relationships worth preserving if anyone ever nudges this:

- Node edge `0.190 + 0.140 = 0.330` — the deck starts exactly where the left
  node ends, and ends exactly where the right node begins.
- Apex base spans `0.330 → 0.670`, the same `0.340` module as the deck.
- Ink extents: `x 0.020 → 0.980`, `y 0.055 → 0.895` at `stroke = 0.06`. Optical
  center `y ≈ 0.475`, deliberately a touch above the box center because the
  figure is top-heavy.

### 2.3 Stroke

```
stroke = clamp( round(size × 0.06 × 2) / 2 , min 1.5 , ∞ )
```

Snapped to half a pixel, floor 1.5 px. This is exactly the existing
`IconGenerator.StrokeWidth(size, 0.06)` contract — do not change that helper.

| size | stroke |
| --- | --- |
| 16 | 1.5 |
| 24 | 1.5 |
| 32 | 2.0 |
| 48 | 3.0 |
| 96 | 6.0 |
| 300 | 18.0 |

Caps: **round**. Joins: **round**. (Same as today.)

### 2.4 Paint

Two-tone. The **deck and nodes are ink** — the model and the agent, the things
that already exist. The **apex is brand** — the bridge, the only thing this
product adds. That split is the reason the mark is not just a triangle, and it
is what tells the brand mark apart from the monochrome Connect icon two
buttons away on the same ribbon.

| Part | Light theme | Dark theme |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deck, node strokes | `--amb-ink` `#18202C` | `--amb-ink` `#E9EEF5` |
| Node wash fill | `rgba(24, 32, 44, 0.12)` | `rgba(233, 238, 245, 0.16)` |
| Apex stroke | `--amb-brand` `#0091A7` | `--amb-brand` `#3FC3D6` |
| Apex wash fill | `rgba(0, 145, 167, 0.20)` | `rgba(63, 195, 214, 0.20)` |

The ink wash is lighter than the accent wash on purpose. A near-white fill at
`0.20` over a dark surface turns the nodes into solid discs and the deck reads
as a strike-through; a near-black fill at `0.20` over white is just as heavy.
Accent hues are mid-luminance and take `0.20` in both themes.

**Monochrome variant** (favicon, disabled state, single-color print, and the
Connect / Disconnect icons): every stroke in one color, every wash in that
color at `0.20`.

### 2.5 Wordmark lockup — for `assets/logo.svg` and the README

```
viewBox="0 0 560 168"
```

| Item | Placement |
| --- | --- |
| Mark | `size = 120`, translated to `(24, 24)` — i.e. mark box occupies `x 24…144`, `y 24…144` |
| "AEC Model Bridge" | Segoe UI, weight 600, `font-size: 46`, `letter-spacing: 0`, `fill: #18202C`, baseline at `x = 188, y = 88` |
| "Model context for Revit" | Segoe UI, weight 400, `font-size: 19`, `letter-spacing: 0.2`, `fill: #5B6676`, baseline at `x = 190, y = 120` |

- Sentence case. No tracked-out caps, no em-dash fragments.
- Clear space on all sides: **≥ 0.25 × mark size** (30 px at the lockup scale).
- Minimum reproduction size of the mark alone: **16 px**. Minimum for the full
  lockup: **180 px** wide.
- `assets/logo.svg` ships the **light-theme** paint and adds
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` inside its `<style>` block so it also
  reads on GitHub's dark README.
- The isometric cube polygons and the `AEC` / `BRIDGE` text in the current file
  are deleted outright — not recolored.

### 2.6 Panel rail mark (`panel/styles.css` `.brand-mark`)

Replace the three stacked `linear-gradient()`s with the mark as an inline
`<svg>` in `panel/index.html` (26 × 26, two-tone, dark-rail paint).
Do **not** try to rebuild the mark out of CSS gradients — that is how the
third inconsistent mark happened.

---

## 3. Color

### 3.1 Reading the table

Every token resolves to one value under the light theme and one under the dark
theme, exactly like the existing `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block in
`panel/styles.css`. On the ribbon, `IconGenerator.IsDarkTheme()` already makes
the same choice.

Contrast figures are measured against that theme's `--amb-surface`
(`#FFFFFF` / `#1C222B`), or against white for the solid badge fills.

### 3.2 Neutrals — the structure

| Token | Light | Dark | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--amb-ink` | `#18202C` | `#E9EEF5` | Primary text; every icon's structural stroke |
| `--amb-ink-muted` | `#5B6676` | `#9BA8B9` | Secondary text, metadata, inactive icon |
| `--amb-bg` | `#F2F5F8` | `#14181E` | App background |
| `--amb-surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#1C222B` | Cards, topbar, inputs |
| `--amb-surface-raised` | `#E9EEF4` | `#232A34` | Pills, hovered rows, segmented controls |
| `--amb-line` | `#D3DAE3` | `#2F3945` | 1 px borders and dividers |
| `--amb-rail` | `#141B24` | `#141B24` | Nav rail — **dark in both themes**, as today |
| `--amb-rail-ink` | `#C9D4E2` | `#C9D4E2` | Nav rail label and inactive glyph |

Measured: ink 16.4:1 light / 13.7:1 dark. Muted 5.8:1 light / 6.7:1 dark.

`--amb-ink` light is `#18202C`, the value already in `panel/styles.css`.
Kept on purpose — it is correct, and continuity beats novelty for neutrals.

### 3.3 Brand

| Token | Light | Dark | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--amb-brand` | `#0091A7` | `#3FC3D6` | Mark apex; focus ring; active nav indicator |
| `--amb-brand-strong` | `#046B80` | `#6FD8E6` | Brand-colored **text** and links; primary button hover |
| `--amb-brand-wash` | `rgba(0, 145, 167, 0.14)` | `rgba(63, 195, 214, 0.14)` | Tinted brand surfaces |

Measured: `--amb-brand` 3.8:1 on white, 4.2:1 on `#1C222B` — above the 3:1
floor for graphics in both themes, which is why one hue serves both.
`--amb-brand-strong` 5.6:1 / 9.7:1 — safe for text.

**Why this hue.** It is the one saturated family that no semantic token below
occupies, so the brand never gets read as a status. It is also the color of an
instrument readout — displacement plots, point-cloud intensity, total-station
displays — which is the vernacular this product actually lives in. It is
deliberately *not* Autodesk's `#0696D7`: the panel is a guest inside Revit, not
a part of it.

**Primary buttons.** `panel/styles.css` currently paints the submit/save
buttons with `--blue` (`#2563eb`), which is now the *info* token. Repaint them
with `--amb-brand` (light) / `--amb-brand` (dark) and white / `#06222A` label
respectively.

### 3.4 Semantic — shared by ribbon icons and panel badges

| Token | Light | Dark | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--amb-danger` | `#C23B2E` | `#F0796B` | Error finding; disconnected; destructive action |
| `--amb-warning` | `#A45F0B` | `#F2A63C` | Warning finding; health check; degraded |
| `--amb-info` | `#2457C5` | `#7FA6F5` | Info finding; status readout; report |
| `--amb-success` | `#127A4B` | `#3FCB8B` | Connected; passed; approved |
| `--amb-pending` | `#6D3FB8` | `#B79AF0` | Awaiting a human decision |
| `--amb-idle` | `#5B6676` | `#9BA8B9` | Inert: not run yet, disabled, n/a |

Measured against white (the solid badge label color), light column:
danger 5.3:1, warning 5.0:1, info 6.5:1, success 5.4:1, pending 6.8:1,
idle 5.8:1. All pass AA for 11 px text.
Measured against `#1C222B`, dark column: 5.8 / 7.9 / 6.6 / 7.7 / 6.8 / 6.7.

> The current `.badge.warning` uses `#b7791f`, which is **3.6:1 against its own
> white label** — it fails AA today. `#A45F0B` is the fix, not a restyle.

### 3.5 The `pending` mismatch — resolved

**`pending` is violet. `#6D3FB8` light, `#B79AF0` dark. Both surfaces.**

- `IconGenerator.CreatePendingIcon()`: `#7B1FA2` → `--amb-pending`.
- `panel/styles.css` `.badge.pending`: `#64748b` → `--amb-pending`.

The ribbon was right and the panel was wrong. `pending` in this product means
"a plan is sitting in the approval queue and nothing moves until you act"
(ADR 0008). That is the single most action-required state in the app, and grey
is the universal signal for *ignore me*. A grey approval queue is a queue
nobody empties.

Violet, not amber or red, because nothing is wrong — it is held, not failing.
Violet is also the only semantic hue with no other job in this palette.

The vacated grey is **not** deleted. It becomes `--amb-idle` and now has a real
job: states that genuinely are inert — a health check that has never run, a
disabled nav item, an unavailable provider.

**Implementer note for Task 7:** `panel/app.js` `renderPlans()` hardcodes
`class="badge pending"` while printing `plan.status` as the label, so a plan
whose status is `approved` currently renders a violet "approved" badge. Map the
status string to a token class (`approved` → `success`, `rejected` → `danger`,
`pending`/anything else → `pending`) at the same time.

### 3.6 Badge treatment

Light theme — solid fill, white label:

```css
.badge            { border-radius: 999px; padding: 3px 9px; font-size: 11px;
                    font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 0.01em;
                    text-transform: capitalize; color: #fff; }
.badge.error      { background: #C23B2E; }
.badge.warning    { background: #A45F0B; }
.badge.info       { background: #2457C5; }
.badge.success    { background: #127A4B; }
.badge.pending    { background: #6D3FB8; }
.badge.idle       { background: #5B6676; }
```

Dark theme — 14 % tint, 40 % hairline, lifted label:

```css
.badge.error   { background: rgba(240,121,107,.14); border: 1px solid rgba(240,121,107,.40); color: #F0796B; }
.badge.warning { background: rgba(242,166, 60,.14); border: 1px solid rgba(242,166, 60,.40); color: #F2A63C; }
.badge.info    { background: rgba(127,166,245,.14); border: 1px solid rgba(127,166,245,.40); color: #7FA6F5; }
.badge.success { background: rgba( 63,203,139,.14); border: 1px solid rgba( 63,203,139,.40); color: #3FCB8B; }
.badge.pending { background: rgba(183,154,240,.14); border: 1px solid rgba(183,154,240,.40); color: #B79AF0; }
.badge.idle    { background: rgba(155,168,185,.14); border: 1px solid rgba(155,168,185,.40); color: #9BA8B9; }
```

The 14 % tint is the largest value that still leaves the lifted label at
≥ 4.5:1 over the tinted surface (measured 4.7:1 for the tightest case, danger).
Do not raise it.

Add `border: 1px solid transparent` to the base `.badge` rule so the box does
not resize between themes.

`text-transform` changes from `uppercase` to `capitalize`. Uppercase at 11 px
costs real legibility on words like "warning" and buys nothing; the pill shape
already marks it as a status.

### 3.6.1 Alpha washes

| Name | Alpha | Hex byte (WPF `Color.FromArgb`) | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| wash | `0.14` | `0x24` (36) | Badge tints, tinted panel surfaces |
| wash-strong | `0.20` | `0x33` (51) | Accent interior fills in icons and the mark |
| wash-ink | `0.12` light / `0.16` dark | `0x1F` (31) / `0x29` (41) | Ink interior fills in icons and the mark |

Only these two. The current icons use four different alphas (`32`, `64`, `90`,
and opaque) — that is part of what makes the ribbon look assembled rather than
designed.

### 3.7 Surface treatment — the glassmorphism the ADR promised

ADR 0011 §4 committed to "sleek dark mode default, subtle micro-animations,
glassmorphism card layouts". Delivering that means exactly two translucent
surfaces — the rail and the topbar — not translucent everything.

```css
/* dark */
--amb-glass:        rgba(28, 34, 43, 0.72);
--amb-glass-line:   rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.07);
--amb-glass-filter: blur(14px) saturate(140%);

/* light */
--amb-glass:        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.72);
--amb-glass-line:   rgba(16, 24, 40, 0.08);
--amb-glass-filter: blur(14px) saturate(120%);
```

Applied to `.rail` and `.topbar` only. Cards, inputs and list rows stay opaque
— glass behind body text is a legibility tax with no benefit.

Elevation:

```css
/* light */ --amb-shadow-1: 0 1px 2px rgba(16,24,40,.08);
            --amb-shadow-2: 0 6px 16px rgba(16,24,40,.10);
/* dark  */ --amb-shadow-1: 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,.04) inset;
            --amb-shadow-2: 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,.04) inset, 0 10px 28px rgba(0,0,0,.45);
```

Radius: `4` chips · `6` buttons, inputs, selects · `8` cards, alerts, messages ·
`10` the rail mark plate · `999` pills and badges.

Spacing scale (px): `4 · 6 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 24 · 32`.

Focus ring — one rule, everywhere, replacing the current
`button:hover { border-color: … }` as the only visible affordance:

```css
:focus-visible { outline: none;
                 box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--amb-bg), 0 0 0 4px var(--amb-brand); }
```

Motion:

```css
--amb-motion-fast: 120ms cubic-bezier(.4, 0, .2, 1);   /* hover, press */
--amb-motion-view: 180ms cubic-bezier(.2, .7, .3, 1);  /* view switch */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { * { animation: none !important; transition: none !important; } }
```

---

## 4. Typography

**Decision: keep `"Segoe UI", system-ui, sans-serif` for everything.**
Recorded explicitly so it stops being an accident.

One family, no display face, no webfont. The panel is a docked pane inside
Revit; a loaded webfont would flash on every panel open and would make the app
look like a web page embedded in Revit rather than a part of it. Distinctiveness
is spent on the mark and the icon grammar instead.

| Role | Size | Weight | Line height | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| View title (`h1`) | 18 px | 650 | 1.2 | Unchanged from today |
| Card title (`h2`) | 14 px | 600 | 1.3 | |
| Body | 13 px | 400 | 1.45 | |
| Secondary / detail | 12 px | 400 | 1.45 | `--amb-ink-muted` |
| Metadata, timestamps | 11 px | 400 | 1.4 | `--amb-ink-muted` |
| Badge | 11 px | 600 | 1 | `letter-spacing: .01em`, capitalize |
| Rail label ("AMB") | 10 px | 600 | 1 | `letter-spacing: .06em` |

Additional rules:

- Sentence case for all UI strings. No tracked-out all-caps eyebrow labels.
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on the run log, finding counts, and any
  timestamp, so columns of numbers stop shifting.
- Body copy caps at ~72 characters per line; the panel is narrow enough that
  this only affects the settings view.
- The wordmark is the same family at weight 600 — the mark carries the
  identity, the wordmark just says the name.

---

## 5. Icon system

### 5.1 The grammar — one rule for all nine

> **Structure is ink. One accent, and only if the icon reports a state.**

Every icon is drawn with `--amb-ink` strokes. Then:

- **State icons** — the icon reports a condition the user should scan for —
  get exactly one element in a semantic color.
- **Action icons** — the icon is a verb with no condition attached — get
  **no accent at all**. Ink only, with interiors filled at wash-ink.

That is the whole system. It is why the ribbon currently looks like eight
unrelated stickers: eight icons, eight hues, none of them meaning anything. A
ribbon where only the five state icons are colored is scannable at a glance.

Brand cyan appears on the brand mark and nowhere else in the ribbon, which is
what makes the brand button findable.

Shared across all icons: stroke per §2.3 (`size × 0.06`), round caps, round
joins, interiors at wash-strong / wash-ink (§3.6.1), `IsDarkTheme()` picks the
theme column.

### 5.2 Re-targeting table — Task 6 follows this directly

| # | `IconGenerator` method | Tier | Structure | Accent token | Accent light / dark | Was |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `CreateConnectIcon` | state | *mono — accent* | `--amb-success` | `#127A4B` / `#3FCB8B` | `#2E7D32` emerald |
| 2 | `CreateDisconnectIcon` | state | *mono — accent* | `--amb-danger` | `#C23B2E` / `#F0796B` | `#D32F2F` crimson |
| 3 | `CreateStatusIcon` | state | `--amb-ink` | `--amb-info` | `#2457C5` / `#7FA6F5` | `#0288D1` "Autodesk blue" |
| 4 | `CreateSettingsIcon` | action | `--amb-ink` | **none** | — | already ink-only |
| 5 | `CreateHelpIcon` | action | `--amb-ink` | **none** | — | `#009688` teal — dropped |
| 6 | `CreatePanelIcon` | action | `--amb-ink` | **none** | — | `#3F51B5` indigo — dropped |
| 7 | `CreateHealthIcon` | state | `--amb-ink` | `--amb-warning` | `#A45F0B` / `#F2A63C` | `#F57C00` amber |
| 8 | `CreatePendingIcon` | state | `--amb-ink` | `--amb-pending` | `#6D3FB8` / `#B79AF0` | `#7B1FA2` violet |
| 9 | `CreateReportsIcon` | action | `--amb-ink` | **none** | — | `#1976D2` blue — dropped |
| — | `CreateBrandIcon` | mark | `--amb-ink` | `--amb-brand` | `#0091A7` / `#3FC3D6` | gradient cube — deleted |

Nine icons, nine explicit assignments, no gaps.

### 5.3 Per-icon notes

**1 · Connect** — becomes the mark of §2.2, drawn **monochrome in
`--amb-success`**: every stroke green, both washes green at `0.20`. Being
monochrome is what keeps it distinct from the two-tone brand mark sitting a
few buttons away on the same ribbon.

**2 · Disconnect** — identical to Connect but monochrome in `--amb-danger`,
plus a **single** cancel slash `(0.300, 0.290) → (0.700, 0.690)`, stroke
`size × 0.08`, round caps, same danger color. One slash, not a cross — a cross
over a triangle is mush at 16 px, and the single diagonal already reads as
“not connected”. Drop the broken-connector treatment; the slash is the signal.

**3 · Status** — geometry unchanged. Frame, both grid lines and the outer ring
go to `--amb-ink`; the inner pulse dot (`r = 0.055`, filled) and its `r = 0.14`
ring stay accented, now `--amb-info`, ring fill at wash-strong.

**4 · Settings** — geometry and paint unchanged. It was already correct; it is
the reference for the action tier.

**5 · Help** — remove the teal balloon fill and the teal stroke. Circle stroked
in ink, filled at wash-ink; the `?` glyph in ink. Segoe UI Bold at
`size × 0.54`, as today.

**6 · Panel** — remove the indigo. Frame and content rows in ink; the docked
right-hand strip filled at wash-ink with an ink stroke.

**7 · Health** — clipboard body, clip tab and rows in ink; **the checkmark** is
the accent, `--amb-warning`. Warning rather than success because the tool's job
is to surface problems, and a permanently green check implies a result the
button has not produced yet.

**8 · Pending** — the three queue rows in ink; **the clock badge** (ring, fill,
both hands) in `--amb-pending`, fill at wash-strong. This is the ribbon half of
the §3.5 fix.

While you are in there, fix the clipping: the badge is currently centred at
`(0.74, 0.76)` with `r = 0.23`, so its bottom edge lands at `0.99` and the
stroke is cut off by the bitmap boundary at every size. Move it to
`(0.730, 0.740)` with `r = 0.210`; hands then run to `(0.730, 0.6245)` and
`(0.825, 0.761)`.

**9 · Reports** — remove the blue. All three bars filled at wash-ink with ink
strokes, baseline in ink. The tinted fills keep it from reading hollow.

**Brand** — the two-tone mark of §2.2/§2.4, identical at every size. Delete
the gradient-cube code entirely.

### 5.4 Panel nav rail glyphs

`panel/index.html` renders the six nav items as single letters
(`C P F R L S`). Leave them as letters — swapping in six new glyphs is a
separate piece of work and is not covered by this token set. Style only:

- inactive: `--amb-rail-ink`, weight 600, 13 px
- hover: `--amb-ink` `#E9EEF5` on `rgba(255,255,255,.08)`
- active: `--amb-ink` `#E9EEF5` on `rgba(63,195,214,.14)` plus a 2 px
  `--amb-brand` bar on the rail's inner edge, radius 0 2px 2px 0

## 6. Copy-site checklist for Tasks 5–7

| Task | File | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | `assets/logo.svg` | §2.2 geometry, §2.4 light paint + dark media query, §2.5 lockup |
| 6 | `packages/revit-bridge-addin/src/UI/IconGenerator.cs` | §2.2–2.4 for `CreateBrandIcon`/`CreateConnectIcon`/`CreateDisconnectIcon`, §3.2–3.4 hexes, §3.6.1 alpha bytes, §5.2 table, §5.3 notes |
| 7 | `panel/styles.css`, `panel/index.html`, `panel/app.js` | §2.6 inline rail mark, §3.2–3.7 all tokens, §3.5 badge fix + `renderPlans()` status mapping, §4 type scale, §5.4 rail glyph styling |

Each of the three files gets a `// keep in sync with docs/design/tokens.md`
comment at the top of the block that carries copied values.
